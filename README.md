# Sentiment Analysis of Stock News

A script to analyze the sentiment of news articles of stocks on **FinViz**, which is a stock screener. This script is written following a [Tinker Tuesday tutorial](https://blog.thecodex.me/sentiment-analysis-tool-for-stock-trading/?utm_content=educational&utm_campaign=2020-07-21&utm_source=email-sendgrid&utm_term=10260436&utm_medium=1316578) from TheCodex.


## Motivation 
In my course of studying computer science, I have been interested in the intersectionality of computer science and other academic and professional fields. After taking ACCT 110 at Drexel University, an introduction to accounting class and the abundance of friends in the Lebow Business School, I have began to grow an interest in the intersection between business and programming. I found this tutorial online and was immediately intrigued to give it a try.
